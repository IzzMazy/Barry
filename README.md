## Hosted Version
If you do not want to run your own instance of this bot you can invite my freely hosted version [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=815455699114262568&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Please note that this is likely to be a bit behind the repo at times

Also it is possible that it will be down for short periods as this is hosted on my home server which is prone to semi frequent tinkering
## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/mazylol/mazbot.git

4. Enjoy your bot :smiley:
