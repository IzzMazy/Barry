A multi purpose discord bot that can do pretty much everything

An Update
-------------
This project is kind of at a standstill. As you may know the library I am using is [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) which has recently been abandonded view `this <https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1>`__ to see all the info why. Well as this will no longer be updated I will either have to move to a new library, go to discord.js, or stop development all together. I guess I am kind of lost. Will make another update when I have a surefire way of continuing this project.
