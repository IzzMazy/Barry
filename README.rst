A multi purpose discord bot that can do pretty much everything

An Update
-------------
This project is kind of at a standstill. As you may know the library I am using is `discord.py <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`__ which has recently been abandonded view `this <https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1>`__ to see all the info why. So as of now I am using discord4py which is a fork which is apparently going to be maintained. Once better forks come out I will probably switch.
